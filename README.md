# Pluginbase
Base project for creating plugins that can be added to any page or type of application

# Getting Started
In this first approach or version of the application we will use vanilla javascript without a lot of features like obfuscation or minification or key management since what we want is understand how we are going to use the plugin or how the ui is going to look on the site and not something specific like trying to consume an API or having only a call to the js file instead of two different files and image calling

# Using the plugin
This plugin is not oriented for use is more for learning purposes
